@unnumberedsec Conventions

@c Copied mostly verbatim from the gawk manual.

@cindex Texinfo document formatting language
This @value{DOCUMENT} is written in an enhanced version of
@uref{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/, Texinfo},
the GNU documentation formatting language.
A single Texinfo source file is used to produce both the printed and online
versions of a program's documentation.
@ifnotinfo
Because of this, the typographical conventions
are slightly different than in other books you may have read.
@end ifnotinfo

Examples you would type at the command-line are preceded by the common
shell primary and secondary prompts, @samp{$} and @samp{>}.  Input that
you type is shown @kbd{like this}.  Output from the command is preceded
by the glyph ``@print{}''.  This typically represents the command's
standard output.  Error messages, and other output on the command's
standard error, are preceded by the glyph ``@error{}''.  For example:

@example
$ @kbd{echo hi on stdout}
@print{} hi on stdout
$ @kbd{echo hello on stderr 1>&2}
@error{} hello on stderr
@end example

@ifnotinfo
In the text, command names appear in @code{this font}, while code segments
appear in the same font and quoted, @samp{like this}.  Options look
like this: @option{-f}.  Some things are emphasized @emph{like this},
and if a point needs to be made strongly, it is done @strong{like this}.
The first occurrence of a new term is usually its @dfn{definition} and
appears in the same font as the previous occurrence of ``definition''
in this sentence.  Finally, file names are indicated like this:
@file{/path/to/our/file}.

@node Description
@unnumberedsec Course Description

Note: This course assumes you've got the basics of React and Redux down.
Check out my course 'Modern React with Redux', its the perfect
preparation!

Go beyond the basics of React and Redux!  This course will teach you to
combine the ultra-popular React, Redux, Express, and MongoDB
technologies to build a fullstack web application.

Advanced Deployment? You will learn it.  Billing/Payments? Included.
Handling Email? Of course!

@subsubheading What Will You Build?

All of my courses are 'learn-by-doing': no boring endless lectures with
Powerpoints, only live, interactive coding examples.  In this course
we'll build one massive web application that profiles the advanced
features of React, Redux, Express, and Mongo.  By putting each concept
into a real app, you'll get a better idea of when to use each unique and
powerful feature.

Build a large feedback-collection app. This mega app will include the
full gamut of features, including everything from authentication to
email handling.  You'll learn how to build an app that can be used to
send mass emails to a big list of users for the purpose of collecting
feedback.  It's my goal to ensure you understand each feature we build
into this app so you can apply them to your own personal or professional
projects in the future.

@subsubheading Here's what we'll learn

@itemize
@item
Learn the architectural considerations of building a full stack app

@item
Connect a front-end Create-React-App server to a NodeJS and Express

provide direction on getting all of these technologies to work
together.

Browser at domain sends browseree an HTML document and some files that

@item
React application does not have the data; the data will be stored on a
Mongo database, i.e., surveys and results of surveys.  The problem to be
solved will be how to get the data in the Mongo database into the React
application.

@item
The React app will never communicate directly with MongoDB; instead,
there will be an Express API in between the React app and the Mongo
database.  The API takes in requests from the app, pulls information out
of the database, and sends it to the app.

@item
React and Express communicate solely through HTTP requests (AJAX
requests); each request contains some JSON.

@item Node
Javascript runtime used to execute code outside of the browswer;
traditionally, JavaScript code has always been executed inside a web

JavaScript code outside the browswer in some other environments; Node
makes that possible.

@item Express
Library that runs in the Node runtime; has helpers (functions) to make

@subheading How Node and Express Work Together
@cindex port
@cindex HTTP requests
@cindex HTTP responses
@cindex requests
@cindex reponses
@cindex route handlers
@cindex Route Handler

When a server is running, it is looking for HTTP traffic coming in on a
particular @dfn{port}, a door through which HTTP requests can be
routed.  Node listens for traffic on a particular port and then takes
that information and hands it off to @file{express} for help.  Node
actually handles all of the underlying HTTP traffic.

@file{express} then looks at the @dfn{request} and decides what part of
its code will @dfn{handle} or respond to that request.  The coder will
write a collection of @dfn{route handlers} to handle HTTP requests that
are asking for a very particular service.

@itemize
@item
Route Handler #1

@item
Route Handler #2

@item
Route Handler #3
@end itemize

These route handlers then send a @dfn{response} back to Node, and Node
will respond to the incoming HTTP request.

@node Express Apps
@section Generating Express Apps
@cindex express apps
@cindex index.js

Create the root file @file{index.js} in the root directory of the
project: @value{PROJECT}

@<Makefile Filename Definitions Hook@>=
INDEX.JS := index.js
@

Import @file{express} library, then create an @samp{application} by
executing the @file{express} code.  That is, inside of a single Node.js
project, there might be several different @file{express} applications.
Executing @file{express} as a function returns a running express app
referenced by the @var{app} variable.

@var{app} is used to set up configuration to listen for incoming HTTP
requests that are being routed from Node to @file{express} and will then
route those requests to different route handlers.  The route handlers
will be associated with the @file{express} @var{app} that we create here.

@node Heroku Deployment
@section Heroku Deployment
@cindex Heroku deployment
@cindex heroku deployment
@cindex deployment, Heroku

This section will be about deploying our application to the Internet via
Heroku, making changes, then redeploying the changes.

@url{https://www.heroku.com, Heroku}

Deployment occurs in two phases, outlined below.  The steps involve,
first, getting signed up to Heroku, installing Heroku's command-line
interface (CLI), creating an app on Heroku, then sending your app's code
to Heroku, at which time Heroku assembles the app and deploys it; then
second, making changes to your app's code, and redeploying to Heroku.

@node Preparing for Deployment
@subsection Preparing for Deployment
@cindex deployment preparation
@vindex PORT
@cindex dynamic port binding
@cindex port assignment

Preparing for deployment means providing the information that Heroku
will need in order to get the app up and running, such as port
information, the app's runtime environment (required versions of Node
and NPM), the app's entry point, and so forth.

Preparing for deployment also involves obtaining Heroku's command-line
interface for communicating with Heroku from the command-line, which
allows you to log into Heroku, create an app on Heroku, and send code to
the app on Heroku.

@table @b
@item Dynamic Port Binding
Heroku dynamically assigns a port on which our app will listen, so we need
to incorporate that port assignment into our app using an environment
variable that Heroku uses: @samp{process.env.PORT}; in the alternative,
we can use a default port assignment, such as 5000, if we are deploying
locally. 

@<IndexJS Port Assignment@>=
const PORT = process.env.PORT || process.env.DEV_0_PORT;
@

@item Specify Node Environment
@cindex node environment
@cindex environment, node
@cindex engines, node and npm
We want to use a specific version of Node, so we need to tell Heroku
which version we want; by default, Heroku uses an older version of Node
which would not be compatible with what this app will be doing.

This is done by adding an @samp{engines} attribute to the
@file{package.json} file, which specify the Node and NPM versions that
we want Heroku to use.  The code should read:

@example
"engines": @{
  "node": "8.1.1",
  "npm": "5.0.3"
@},
@end example

@xref{Sed Utility} and
@pxref{Makefile Sed Utility Additions}

@item Specify Start Script
@cindex start script
Instruct Heroku what command to run to start our server running

Delete the @samp{test} script, and replace it with:

@example
"scripts": @{
  "start": "node index.js"
@},
@end example

@item Craete .gitignore File
@cindex .gitignore file, Heroku

We don't want to include dependencies; Heroku will do that for us 

Add @file{node_modules} to the project's @file{.gitignore} file.
@xref{Heroku Gitignore File}
@end table

@node Sed Utility
@subsubsection Sed Utility

There does not seem to be any easy way to either set up a default
@file{engines} attribute using @code{npm init} or to edit the code using
@file{npm}, so I am here creating a little utility @file{sed} script to
insert the @code{engines} attributes and also change the @file{scripts}

The @code{GoogleStrategy} object needs to know the @code{clientID} and
@code{clientSecret}, as well as a @code{callback} route.  These are
obtained from the @file{keys.js} file imported above.  There also needs
to be a @code{callback} function that receives Google's @code{access
token} as a parameter.  More parameters can be included, but for now,
just log the access token in the callback.  In other words, the
@samp{GoogleStrategy} object takes two parameters, options and callback,
and the callback takes one parameter, an @samp{access token}:

@subsubheading Google Strategy Object

@node Testing OAuth
@section Testing OAuth

@cindex testing, oauth

At this point we have put together the minimum amount of information for
the Google strategy to work.  The Google Strategy receives some
configuration options and a lambda function as a callback to handle the
access token received from Google.  We will ignore the callback for the
time being and just log it to the console.

When a User clicks @key{Login}, a route handler should direct that User
to the Google Strategy OAuth authorization mechanism, which is managed
by @file{PassportJS}.  Therefore, we need to create a route handler to
handle this event.  The callback function will utilize the
@file{passport} functionality.

@node Review OAuth Flow
@subsection Review of OAuth Flow

@itemize
@item
User clicks @key{Login}

@item
Directed to the Express server at the URL
@url{http://localhost:5000/auth/google}

@item
The Express server will then forward the User to the Google server

@item
User is asked to grant permission for the App to access their
information

@item
Assuming the User does grant permission, the User will be sent back to
the Express server at the URL and with an authorization code:
@url{http://localhost:5000/auth/google/callback?code=456}  
@end itemize

@node Route Handler Implementation
@subsection Google Strategy Route Handler Implementation
@cindex implementation, route handler, google strategy

Therefore need to configure the server to send and receive the User, as
per the above.  This is done by creating a route handler at
@code{/auth/google} that sends the User into the Passport object for
processing and then receives the response from Google at
@code{/auth/google/callback} with a special authorization code as a
query string.

Instead of giving the route handler a callback, give it a Passport
function call into Passport's @code{authenticate} method, with two scope
arguments of @samp{profile} and @samp{email}.  Why @samp{google} as an
argument to @code{authenticate}?  Because the class
@file{GoogleStrategy} has some internal code that sets this string to
Google's oauth strategy code.  The @samp{scope} arguments tell Google
what portions of the User's profile the application is seeking to
access.  These two scopes are not actually needed for this application;
this is just an example of how to request specific scopes.

@<Create Google Auth Route Handlers@>=
@<Create Initial Route Handlers@>
app.get(
  '/auth/google',
  passport.authenticate('google', {
    scope: ['profile', 'email']
  })
);
@

@node Authorized Redirect URIs
@subsection Authorized Redirect URI's
@cindex redirect uri

If the code is run at this point, it will successfully jump into
Google's OAuth authorization section, but then will throw the error
@samp{redirect_uri_mismatch}.  This is caused because we have not
registered this redirect uri with Google.  Google will not allow a
redirect without this authorization as a security feature.

To allow this callback, log into Google API's, tab into
@kbd{credentials}, and add the callback uri to @samp{Authorized redirect
URIs}.

@node OAuth Callbacks
@subsection OAuth Callbacks
@cindex oauth callbacks

Now we need to set up another route handler to handle the redirect from
Google with the authorization code.  When the callback is triggered, it
will forward to Passport the code that is embedded in the uri that is
received from Google.  While the @code{authenticate} method call looks
to be the same, the difference is that the uri contains the
authorization code, which is forwarded to Google by this call.

@<Create Google Auth Route Handlers@>=
app.get('/auth/google/callback',
  passport.authenticate('google')
);
@

@node Tokens
@subsection Access and Refresh Tokens
@cindex tokens, access and refresh

At this point, we can start to take a look at Google Strategy's callback
function.  Currently it is just logging an access token to the console.
Let us log a couple more items to the console using a slightly modified
callback function.

@<Google Strategy Callback Function1@>=
  (accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
    console.log('access token', accessToken);
    console.log('refresh token', refreshToken);
    console.log('profile', profile);
  }

When the server is started and we visit the

the server is hanging, but the server will have received @samp{access
token} and @samp{profile} from Google and logged their values to the
terminal.  These tokens contain our @dfn{identifying information}, i.e.,
our name, email, and other such items.  This is the heart of what we are
getting at in this OAuth section.

@subsubheading Access Token

We could use this access token to access and modify the user's

next steps involve storing the User's data in a data base and logging
them into our application.

@node MongoDB
@chapter Adding MongoDB
@cindex mongodb
@cindex MongoDB

In this chapter, we will first refactor our code by splitting out much
of the logic currently in @file{index.js} into separate directories and
files.  Then, we will review authentication theory and signing in of
Users, both for the first time and subsequent logins.  Then we will
begin to incorporate MongoDB and Mongoose into our project.

We will introduction MongoDB and Mongoose on a conceptual level, then
set up a MongoDB deployment on @file{mLab} and obtain configuration data
to use with our app.  After we get the configuration data, we will
configure out app to actually connect to the @file{mlab} MongoDB
database.

The third phase will then discuss how to use Mongoose to save a User's
Google ID in our Mongo database using Schemas, Model Classes and
Instances.  We will see that requiring all of the code must be done in a
particular order to avoid some difficult errors.  The callback function
in GoogleStrategy will receive the User's Google ID, and save it to a
collection that was previously defined in a schema.

@node Server Refactor
@section Server Structure Refactor
@cindex server, refactor

This is a good point to refactor our code.  There is no consensus in the
Node community on how best to structure projects.  The way chosen in
this project is one possible way, not necessarily the best way for all
projects, but one that works well here.

The restructure will create several new directories and transfer some
code into new files inside these new directories.  The next section
describes the new directories and what will be placed inside them.

code will go into this directory.

@node authRoutes_js
@subsubsection @file{authRoutes.js}
@cindex authRoutes.js

@file{authRoutes.js} will hold the route handling code that is
currently in @file{index.js}.

This file (@file{authRoutes.js}) needs the @file{app} server in order to
set up the routes, and so this code will be wrapped in an arrow function
with one parameter, the @file{app} variable.  @file{index.js} will
import this function, then call it with the @file{app} that it has
created.

@(authRoutes.js@)=
@<Import Passport@>
module.exports = (app) => {

@file{passport.js} file holds all of the @file{passport} logic to
authenticate the User and authorize this app to receive the User's
personal information.  This file needs to import @file{passport},
@file{GoogleStrategy}, and the secret key information.  Then, it
@code{use}'s the @file{GoogleStrategy}.

@node index3_js
@subsubsection @file{index3.js}
@cindex index3.js

Much of the code currently in @file{index.js} will be moved out, which
means much of its imports will not be needed and can be removed.  This
file still needs to set up and start the application's server,
@file{app}.  It also needs to call the @file{authRoutes.js} file and
send it the @code{app} that it has created.  Finally, it needs to
connect to the @file{mLab} Mongo database we will create shortly.

To allow code down the line to hook into our app, we will give it a
@samp{Use Hook} right after it is created.

@anchor{Tricky Order}
In many cases, the order of importing is not important.  However,
because of the way the @file{passport.js} file will be implemented,
there is an ordering issue that crops up later.  @file{index.js} must
call both @file{passport.js} and @file{User.js} in order to execute
them.  The code in @file{User.js} creates a Class that
@file{passport.js} uses, and therefore @file{User.js} must be
@code{require}d first, and is included here even though we have not yet
discussed it. @xref{Model Class File User}.

@node Authentication Theory
@section The Theory of Authentication
@cindex authentication theory
@cindex login request

The User wants to be logged into our app, and so sends a @code{login}
request.  The server logs in the User, either as a new User or as a
returning User, by returning a token unique to that User.  Then the app
sends a request to the server and requests some information about the
User.  As part of that request, it sends along the token that it
received from the server.

@cindex stateless, HTTP

However, on its own, HTTP is @dfn{stateless}, that is, knows nothing
about what has happened in the past.  All HTTP requests are equal and
clueless.  Therefore, without more, the server cannot know anything
about a User that logged in previously.

@cindex cookie-based authentication
@cindex Set-Cookie
@cindex token

Therefore, this app will use @dfn{cookie-based} authentication.  The
server will send back a response that includes a @code{Set-Cookie}
key-value pair in the header.  The value will be set to some unique
random token assigned to this user.  The browser will automatically save
the token in its memory and send the token to the server with every
request it makes.  The server will be able to see this token and know
which User it applies to.

@node Signing in Users
@section Signing in Users with OAuth
@cindex users, sign in
@cindex oauth flow
@cindex profile id
@cindex id, profile

This is a high-level view of the OAuth flow.

The User wants to log in, so our app sends the User to Google to sign
in, and then Google sends back to the server an access token and a
profile, among other things.  Thereafter, the User signs out, and then
signs in again.  The server needs to determine whether this a first
login, or a subsequent login.  We can use profile's @samp{id} value.
This is actually Google's sole purpose---provide the server with a
unique identification key based upon User.

The server keeps a MongoDB database of Users and Users' @samp{id}s.
When a User logs in, the server will receive an @samp{id} and check its
database against that @samp{id}.  If the User is not found, the server
will add this User to the database.  If the User is found, the server
will not add the User, but will instead have a reference to the User's
data.

@section Saving Model Instances
@cindex model instances, saving

Now that we have created a @samp{model class}, we need to create and
save a @samp{model instance} so that a User's @code{id} can be stored
and then later retrieved.  The User's profile is obtained from the
callback function associated with the Passport authentication and
authorization call currently in @file{passport.js} (@pxref{Tokens}).
The callback receives several parameters, one of which is a
@code{profile}.  One of the objects attached to this @code{profile} is
the @code{id}.  The callback function receives the @code{profile}, and
extracts the @code{id} from it.  This token must be @code{save}d in our
database in order to retrieve it in future sessions.

@subheading Accessing Mongoose Model Class

First, however, we need to get access to the Mongoose Model that we
created in @file{models/User.js} (@pxref{Model Class File User}).
Usually, this file would @code{export} some code that would then be
@code{require}d by some other code.  We will not do that here because it
would become confused about what Models we were actually using when run
inside a testing environment (@file{mocha} or @file{jest}).  So,
instead, the @file{passport.js} file will @code{require} the
@file{mongoose} package, and then call its @code{model} method with the
collection name: @code{users}.

@subsubheading Require mongoose package

@<Passport Requirements@>=
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
@

@subsubheading Create a User Object

Our @file{User.js} code loaded a @code{userSchema} associated with a
@code{users} collection into Mongoose.  Now, we can extract that schema
into an object by called the @code{model} method with just the
collection name, @code{users}.  The variable @code{User} becomes our
Model Class.  This Model Class can then be used to create a Model
Instance (a single record) that can be persisted in our database.

@<Passport Requirements@>=
const User = mongoose.model('users');
@

@subsubheading Create a Model Instance from User Class
@cindex new User

A @code{new User} represents the creation of a single record, i.e., a
single User inside the database.  The @code{save} method must be called
to persist this record.  This method returns a promise, which will later
be used to call the @code{done} method.

@<Mongoose New User Save@>=
new User({ googleId: profile.id }).save()
@

The new User and save code will be used in the event a new User logs in;
however, we need to first @code{query} our database to see if the User
is new or not; if not, then there is no need to create a new entry in
the database.  The @code{findOne} method simply queries the database for
an existing user.  @xref{Mongoose Queries}. 
@cindex findOne
@cindex done
@anchor{Done}

@<Google Strategy Callback Function2@>=
(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) => {
  @<Mongoose User FindOne@>  
}
@

This callback function is the second argument of the GoogleStrategy
options; the first argument does not change.

@<Google Strategy Options2@>=
@<Google Strategy Object@>,
@<Google Strategy Callback Function2@>
@

Now use the new GoogleStrategy with the new callback:

@<Passport Use GoogleStrategy2@>=

passport.use(
  new GoogleStrategy(
    @<Google Strategy Options2@>
  )
);
@

@node Mongoose Queries
@section Mongoose Queries
@cindex queries, mongoose
@cindex findOne
@cindex asynchronous operation
@cindex promise

At this point our code will simply add a new entry in our database even
if it represents the same User.  This code must be refactored to first
check to see if the User attempting to log in has already logged in
before.  If so, then skip the create User code.  If not, then create a
new User.

We will use our Model Class to search through all of the records in our
database.  We will use a method @code{findOne} on the @code{User} Class
object.  This method is an @dfn{asynchronous} operation and therefore
returns a @code{promise} and is placed first in the callback.  The
promise will return a User Model Instance (@code{existingUser} that will
be null if there is no User already stored in the database.

@<Mongoose User FindOne@>=
 User.findOne({ googleId: profile.id })
   .then( (existingUser) => {
     if (existingUser) {
       // have a record
       console.log(`found an existing user: ${existingUser}`);
       @<Mongoose Done@>

what we have to do and it can proceed with the authentication flow.
Done takes two parameters, as follows: @anchor{done function}

@defun done @var{error} @var{USER_RECORD}

its job and Passport can continue its authentication flow.

@cindex encoding users
@cindex serializeUser

Passport will call a function @code{serializeUser} with the User's
@code{id} that it has obtained from Google.  This will set a
@dfn{cookie} in the User's browser.  When a logged-in User makes another
request to the server, that @samp{cookie} will automatically be sent by
the browser.  Passport will then take that @samp{cookie} and call a
second function called @code{deserializeUser}.  Passport will use that
cookie to return a User Model to the server.

@node Serialize User
@subsection Serialize User Function
@cindex serializeUser
@cindex done

Serialize User is already a function in Passport; we provide it with a
function as its parameter.  Our function takes two arguments:
@code{user} (our User Instance) and @code{done}.  @samp{done} takes two
parameters: an error, and an @samp{id} (MongoDB's id code, not the
Google id).  @xref{done function}

@<Serialize User@>=
passport.serializeUser(
  (user, done) => {
    done(null, user.id);
  }
);
@

@(passport1.js@)=
@<Serialize User@>
@

@node Deserialize User
@subsection Deserialize User
@cindex deserialize user
@cindex deserializeUser
@cindex findById

@dfn{Deserialize User} means to take a @samp{user.id} and turn that into
an actual @samp{user model}.  @command{passport.deserializeUser} takes a
callback that we define:

@<Deserialize User@>=
passport.deserializeUser(
  @<Deserialize User Callback@>
);
@

@subsubheading Deserialize User Callback

Our callback will take two parameters: @var{USER_ID} and @var{done}.  We
will use the @var{USER_ID} to obtain a Mongoose Model Instance
@var{user}.  We do that by using the Mongoose method
@code{User.findById()}.

@<Deserialize User Callback@>=
(id, done) => {
  @<Mongoose findById Method@>
}
@

@subsubheading Mongoose findById method

@samp{findById} works be receiving an @code{id} and then searching every
document for a record that contains that @code{id}.  Anytime we access
our database, it is done through an @strong{asynchronous} action and so
returns a @strong{promise} that is @strong{resolved} after a @var{user}
with the given @var{id} is found.  After the @var{user} is found, we
will call @code{done} with that @var{user}.  @code{done} always takes
two parameters: an @code{error} object and the @var{user} that we found.

@<Mongoose findById Method@>=
User.findById(id)
  .then (user => {
    done(null, user);
  });
@

@(passport1.js@)=
@<Deserialize User@>
@

@subsubheading Cookies

While we have just defined @code{serializeUser} and
@code{deserializeUser}, we still have to tell @code{Passport} that we
want it to manage our authentication using cookies.  This is only one
way in @code{Passport} can do this job, and so we must instruct it to do
so.  

@node cookie-session
@subsection Enable Cookies with @file{cookie-session}
@cindex cookies, enable
@cindex cookie-session, package
@cindex package cookie-session

Express does not know that we want it to manage authentication of users
by using @samp{cookies}, nor even how to do that, and so it must receive
a helper package, @file{cookie-session}.  This enables @dfn{sessions} in
our app, or the ability to persist data between browser requests.

@node Import cookie-session
@subsubsection Load and Import Cookie-Session and Passport
@cindex require cookie-session
@cindex cookie-session, require
@cindex import cookie-session

@subsubheading Install cookie-session

The first step is to install @file{cookie-session} as a requirement of
our project:

@<Makefile NPM_INSTALLS@>=
NPM_INSTALLS += cookie-session
@

@subsubheading Require cookie-session

and then import this package into our @file{index.js} file.

@<Import Cookie-Sessions@>=
const cookieSession = require('cookie-session');
@

@subsubheading Require passport

In addition to importing@file{cookie-session}, we also need to import
the @file{passport} package into @file{index.js} as well.

@<Index3JS Requirements@>=
@<Import Cookie-Sessions@>
@<Import Passport@>
@

@node Use cookie-session
@subsubsection App Use Cookie-Sessions
@cindex use cookie-session
@cindex cookie-session, use

We have named our @file{Express} server @code{app}.  @code{app} has a
@code{use} method (middleware) which will receive the
@file{cookie-session} code that we just imported.  We will discuss the
@code{use} method of @file{Express} in a later section.

@<App Use Hook@>=
 
/*-------------------
 * CookieSession    
 *-------------------*/
app.use(
  @<App Use cookieSession@>
);
@

@subsubheading Use cookieSession

@file{cookie-session} itself takes two parameters: a @code{maxAge} in
milliseconds, and an array of @code{keys} that are used to encrypt the
cookie.

@<App Use cookieSession@>=
cookieSession({
  @<cookieSession maxAge Parameter@>
  @<cookieSession keys Parameter@>
})
@

@subsubheading maxAge of 30 days

Let's set @code{maxAge} to 30 days (in milliseconds):

@<cookieSession maxAge Parameter@>=
maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
@

@subsubheading cookieKey

Nex, we add an attribute to our @file{keys.js} object to help Express do
the encryption: @samp{cookieKey}, which is a random string of
characters.  Whenever we send out this cookie, it will always be
encrypted.  We place a random string of characters into our
@file{keys.js} @file{config} file so that it is not saved as part of our
public code, but kept secret, and the cookie-session code will read this
random string as part of the exported @file{keys} object.

@<CookieKey@>=
  cookieKey: 'dkdfnvasiiennvkldaldkeislsldf',
@

Place this @code{cookieKey} into @file{keys.js}:

@<Keys_JS Internals@>=
@<CookieKey@>
@

The @code{cookie-session} parameter reads this @code{cookieKey} from the
@file{keys.js} object.  @file{cookie-session} takes an array of random
strings, and randomly picks one each time as an extra measure of
security. 

@<cookieSession keys Parameter@>=
keys: [keys.cookieKey]
@

@node Passport Use Cookies
@subsubsection Passport Use Cookies
@cindex use cookies

The last step is tell @file{Passport} that it should make use of
@samp{cookies} to handle authentication.  First, @command{initialize}
@file{Passport}, and then tell @file{Passport} to use
@file{cookie-session}.

These last two commands essentially complete authentication for our
app.  It is important that the method @samp{app.use(passport.session())}
be placed @strong{after} the @samp{app.use(cookieSession)} statement.

@<App Use Hook@>=
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
@

@node Testing Authentication
@section Testing Authentication
@cindex authentication, testing

In the last section, we finished wiring up the @samp{authentication
flow} by enabling cookies (telling @file{app} to @code{use} the
@file{cookie-session} library) and then telling @file{Passport} to use
cookies to @samp{manage} our authentication (@code{use
}@code{initialize} and @code{session}).  We are now able to
@samp{authenticate}, but what does this mean for our application?

To test this process, we will add a new route handler whose sole job is

property, then our authentication must be working properly.

@node Route Handler for req user
@subsection Route Handler for @code{req.user}

Add a third route handler to the @file{authRoutes.js} file, underneath
the two handlers dealing with Google's authentication.  This handler
will simply return the @code{req.user} property.

  res.send(req.user);

@node Logging Out Users
@section Logging Out Users
@cindex logging out, users
@cindex users, logging out

One final bit of code is required to allow a User to log out of the
application.  Add a route handler inside @file{authRoutes.js} called
@code{/api/logout} that logs out the User.  Passport adds a method to
the @code{req} object called @samp{logout}.  When this method is
executed, Passport @samp{kills} the @samp{user_id} that is inside the
cookie.  To send a message to the User that that person is actually
logged out, send a message that includes the @samp{user}, which should
be undefined at that point (nothing will be logged to the browser).
Also, hitting @kbd{/api/current_user} should produce a totally blank
browser screen also.

@<AuthRoutes Route Handler Hook@>=
app.get('/api/logout', (req, res) => {
  req.logout();
  res.send(req.user);
});

@node Deeper Dive
@section A Deeper Dive
@cindex deeper

This is an optional discussion about some of the topics that were glazed
over in the discussions above.

@node App Use
@subsection App Use
@cindex app.use
@cindex middleware

There are three separate @code{app.use} calls in the code above, each
call receiving some object.
@xref{Use cookie-session}  @xref{Passport Use Cookies}

These calls are wiring up @dfn{middleware} inside of our application.
Middlewares are small functions that can be used to modify incoming
requests to our app before they are sent off to route handlers.  Refer
to the diagram at @ref{Middleware Diagram}.  Each of the middle objects
is a middleware that is receiving the @samp{request} and making some
minor adjustment to it.

Middlewares are all about doing some preprocessing of the incoming
request before sending it off to the route handlers.  These middlewares
can also be wired up so that they handle just the type of requests that
you want to handle, rather than every request.

@end table

@node Cookie-Session Middleware
@subsection Cookie-Session Middleware
@cindex cookie-session, middleware
@cindex middleware cookie-session
@cindex request session

What is @code{cookie-session} doing?

In the route handler @code{/api/current_user}, change the response to
@kbd{res.send(req.session)} to obtain the @samp{request session} object.
The @code{cookie-session} middleware extracts the @samp{user_id} out of
the cookie it receives from the browser, and assigns it to the
@code{req.session} object.  The @code{req.session} object looks like
@code{passport: @{user: "595f @dots{}"@}}.  @code{req.session} contains the
data that Passport is attempting to store inside the cookie.  When
Passport receives the @code{request} from @code{cookie-session}, it is
looking at the data inside the @code{req.session} object.  Passport then
pulls out the data from @code{req.session} and sends it to
@code{deserializeUser}.

@subsubheading Express Session
@cindex express session, middleware

Express documenation relating to cookies will recommend two different
libraries: @code{cookie-session} and @code{express-session}.  Both
libraries essentially accomplish the same thing, but go about it in
totally different ways.  @code{Express session} works by storing a
@samp{reference} to a session inside the cookie, i.e., a
@code{session_id} rather than a @code{user_id}.  The data is stored in a
database external to the cookie.  The advantage of this method is that
you can store a lot more data than you can store inside a cookie.  The
disadvantage is that it is more complicated and requires more
libraries.  

@node Environments
@chapter Dev vs Prod Environments
@cindex environemnts, dev vs prod
@cindex dev environment
@cindex prod environment

It is time to deploy the application to Heroku again.  We will need to
store production secret keys on Heroku, rather than putting that data on
a local machine.  @xref{Securing API Keys}.  That is, we will need two
separate sets of keys, one entitled @code{Dev} and another entitled
@code{Prod}.  When the @code{Prod} keys are stored remotely, they become
safer from discovery through user error.  @code{Dev} keys are not as
important since they are just used for development and should not refer
to sensitive data.

This is also important in order to keep the @code{Prod} database
prestine, i.e., we won't use it to develop our application.

@node Running Client and Server
@section Running the Client and Server
@cindex running client and server

How do we get the server and client server running at the same time?
One option is to open two terminal windows, start one server in one and
the other server in the other.  Another option is to utilize the package
@file{concurrently} that allows us to run two separate commands
concurrently.

There are now two separate @file{package.json} files: one for the
server, and one for the client.  Go to the server @file{package.json}.
Add two additional scripts, one to start the @file{client} server, and
one to start both the client and the server concurrently.

@node Routing
@section Routing Stumbling Blocks
@cindex routing stumbling blocks
@cindex stumbling blocks, routing

If we wanted to call our back-end server from the client, we would need
to place an anchor tag inside of the @file{App.js} main file in the
@file{client}, and then make an @code{href} with a complete path rather
than a relative path.  However, that would be a mistake because the
production route would be different, and so we would have to change it
before deploying the production app.  We need to find a way to make the
anchor work regardless of which version we were working on, development
or production.

To make this work, our anchor tag would like like:

@code{<a href="/auth/google">Sign In With Google</a>}

As is obvious, the @code{href} is a relative path.

Now, place the following code inside the client @file{package.json}
file:

@example
"proxy": @{
  "/auth/google": @{
    "target": "http://localhost:DEV_PORT"
  @}
@}
@end example

@node Create React App Proxy
@section The Beauty of Create React App's Proxy
@cindex create-react-app proxy

Our goal is to use relative links in the client server, but have the
links correctly forward when the app is deployed in a production
environment.  We added a @samp{proxy} to the client's
@file{package.json} file to redirect anyone trying to access a link with
@code{/auth/google} to @code{http://localhost:8000}.  There is no need
to include a route with target host.

The client server created by Create-React-App includes a proxy inside
that we can access through the @file{package.json} @samp{proxy}
command.  In development mode, any link going to @code{/auth/google}
will automatically be redirected to our express server.

In a production environment, this React server will not exist; instead,
@file{WebPack} will create a production bundle that gets placed into the
@file{build} directory.  Only our back-end server will be running, and
whenever anyone asks for an asset, our production server will reach into
the @file{build} directory and into the bundle, and produce it.
